# Game Name

## Elevator Pitch

The Government sends an agricultural engineer and a computer scientist to another planet to grow food and build their home economy using hydroponics systems managed by for loops and logic gates, but when the player worsens the planet's ecosystem, the wildlife begins to revolt.

## Influences (Brief)

- A student in the Agriculture department is building an automated hemp farm :
  - Medium: Experience
  - Explanation: They may be able to provide more insight about maintaining an ecosystem and planting crops that we could utilize in our game mechanics. 
- Being Computer Science students :
  - Medium: Experience
  - Explanation: A student that is fairly new to Computer Science and programming may have a difficult time grasping the concepts of loops and logic gates. We felt we could incorporate these lessons into the game mechanics by making some of the land cultivation automated using these concepts. 
- Animal Crossing
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: Animal Crossing is an open-ended game with no definitive objectives where the player is able to interact with anthropomorphic animals and the environment extensively from talking to villagers to planting crops. The idea of cultivating a foreign environment and interacting with unique fictional creatures was inspired from this. 

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Farm and tend to crops.
- Work with logic gates and loops to automate production.
- Maintain the surrounding ecosystem.
- Build the farming economy of your home planet.

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains
- Introductory Computer Science Concepts 
- Introductory Economic Practices 
- Introductory Agriculture Practices 


## Target Audiences

- Computer Science students who are fairly new to programming
- Agriculture students who want to work with automation farming
- Appropriate for anyone (kids and adults) who are interested in science fiction and agriculture 


## Target Contexts

- This would be utilized in introductory Computer Science courses such as CISC 106/108 and CISC 260 as either a in-class exercise or homework assignment
- Used to simulate farming situations for hydroponic farms  


## Learning Objectives

- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to experiment with hydroponic farming material.
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to identify different types of seeds
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to build logic gates / loops for automating manufacturing.
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to identify the changes that the use of different ecological materials has on the economy.


## Prerequisite Knowledge

- Prior to starting the game, the player needs to be able to express concepts of supply and demand. 
- Prior to starting the game, the player should be able to list and explain the concept of different loops either in Python or JavaScript. 
- Prior to starting the game, the player should be able to identify the different types of logic gates and their outputs
- Prior to starting the game, players should have a basic understanding of agriculture(planting, watering, harvesting).. 


## Assessment Measures

As the user progresses through each level, they receive points for how efficient their hydroponic system is and can lose points if there are any negative benefactors to the environment.

For example, after doing research the player would need to know what kind of nutrient to give the seed so it can grow. The computer scientist would then be in charge of creating gates that open and close at certain times according to the seeds required watering cycle. If watered incorrectly or given the wrong nutrient, it could pose one of many threats to your home planet or the environment surrounding the farm. 


# What sets this project apart?

- You can learn multiple skills such as farming and coding
- Can be edited to fit classroom examples
- It’s interactive in many fields of study

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

- 1 Player
  - Build starting farm
  - Switch back and forth between two players to manage water movement and harvesting 
  - Use agricultural engineer to upgrade material used
  - Maintain the ecosystem 
  - Build home economy
- 2 Players
  - Take turns as either the agricultural engineer or the computer scientist 
  - If agricultural engineer, build operate and maintain the farm
  - If computer scientist, build wiring for automating farm



## Player Modes

- *Single Player*: Switch between the two engineers to manage the farm. (See Characters)
- *Multiplayer*: Take turns using either the engineer or the computer scientist. (See Characters)


# Gameplay Objectives

- Automate your farm
    - Description: Creating gates that open and close at certain times during a crop's required watering cycle
    - Alignment: In completing this objective, the player will demonstrate their knowledge of logic gate and loops 
- Maintain the ecosystem
    -  Description :  Giving the crops the correct nutrients to yield positive results. 
    -  Alignment:  The player will identify the correct methods that yields positive changes on the ecosystem on the economy.


# Procedures/Actions

You can swap between the Computer Scientist or Agricultural Engineer using the SPACE key to either automate or manually plant crops in the fields and regulate the water systems. 

# Rules

- Do not let the wrong water concentrate interact with the wrong plant
- Do not let watering occur during times it shouldn’t
- Don’t plant crops that do not mix together
- Keep the environment as close to similar as before you arrived as possible
- Produce up to your hometown’s quota


# Objects/Entities
- Animals 
- Trees
- Spaceship
- Home planet 
- Jungle/Forrest 


## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- *Automate your farm*: build systems for watering and tending to crops. Use the correct nutrient for each plant and expand your farm as you produce more. If you fail to accomplish both the current nutrient and water cycle, your overall score will be penalized. 

- *Build your automation system*: Use the computer scientist to build logic gates for controlling water flow. As your farm expands, so should your automation system. To continue to advance, you must use the planet's resources as a form of material for flow. You must then use your knowledge of logic gates to open up each valve at given times. 

- *Build your home economy*: Increase your home economy by selling your produce back home. You can increase food, income and healthiness of the planet. However, if crop becomes spoiled, this can take a toll on your score. 


## Feedback
Starting the farm will be done by the agricultural engineer
When in maintenance, or agricultural engineer mode, you are meant to research, plant, and harvest crop.
Failure to do so correctly will lead to score deduction
When I’m building, or computer scientist mode, you are in charge of keeping the system flowing smoothly with the gates you allow to be open or closed. 
As you advance, you are rewarded more seeds but need to find a way of fitting them all into your farm. 
If you take point loss, it will reflect either in the environment around you changing and becoming more dangerous or your home planet lacking greater resources.


# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

- Give players a seed
- Require Agricultural engineer to research a seed
- Require agricultural engineer to plant seed
- Require agricultural engineer to create proper nutrient 
- Require computer scientist to build system
- Require both to go out and collect more resources from the forest 


## Presentation of Content

Users will begin by receiving a base plot of land. They will then be given a few seeds and a seed reader. The agricultural engineer should begin planting seeds in a certain way so when the computer scientist builds the system, the water flows to each seed currently and at the time required. Failure to do so will result in either faulty crops or damage to the ecosystem.


## Story (Brief)


The Government sends an agricultural engineer and a computer scientist to another planet to grow a foreign food source for them using unique mechanics, such as loops and logic gates, but if the player fails to harvest well and maintain the surrounding ecosystem, the wildlife begins to revolt. The player has a month to reach their government’s quota to prove to their nation their research was not in vain. 

## Storyboarding
The AE and CS have a weekly supply drop of crops and piping from Earth. They can also gather foreign crops / materials at the risk of being injured by the wildlife. Being that this terrain is completely new, we don’t know if they will grow in the same environments like on Earth. It’s their job to find out what works best for the crops. If they waste the crops they either die of starvation or are killed by the planet’s wildlife. 

The A.E. can perform three functions using loops :  Plant, Harvest, Gather Crops
You start off with while loops (inefficient), then for loops (efficient), or switches (very efficient)
The C.S. can perform three functions using logic gates :  Destroy (Clear fields), Automate Farming, Build Piping
